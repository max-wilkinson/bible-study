# Battle of the Mind
## Notes from a sermon by Louie Giglio

Just like with Adam and Eve, Satan's goal is to cause us to distrust God. He wants us to instead rely on our own strength and wisdom.

Satan lures us with lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh, and boastful pride of life. He makes us desire something, and then pits our desire for that thing against God. 

Satan plants a seed of doubt in our mind that tells us:
  - God is holding out on you
  - God can't be trusted
  - God's intentions aren't good 

With this, the battle for our mind has begun. And where our mind goes, the rest of us follows.

_Sow a thought, reap an action_

_Sow an action, reap a habit_

_Sow a habit, reap a character_

How can you identify if a thought is likely from Satan? Beware of thoughts around:
- Fear
- Worry
- Temptation
- Lack of worth/value
- Uncertainty 

There is a war for our hearts and minds. However, Jesus secured a beachhead of victory for us. On the cross, he defeated Satan and provided a way forward for us. 

How do we take every thought captive? 
- Identify the thought 
- Identify where it came from 
- Is it congruent with the Word of God? 
- Bind the thought with truth in obedience to Jesus 
- Change the narrative 
- Remember God's promises 
- Remember whose you are, and what was done for you 

There is a daily battle for your mind. You can either live with a self-defeating "wilderness" mentality, or you can choose to fight the fight, walk out in faith, believe God, and live in the victory that Christ has won.

God will use your struggles and battles to forge you into something incredible: the image of Christ.
If you want to do something great, be prepared to get tested greatly, so that you can be trusted greatly.
